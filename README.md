# Do It! Chrome Extension

A chrome extension that injects Shia Labeouf's motivational speech into your browser.

Available on the chrome web store: [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/do-it/eppncnmppghbndacgkideegigaminkfg?hl=en-US&gl=US&authuser=1)

Built using the chrome extention library and webm video to support alpha video playback. 

I exported the keyed video as a .mov from After Effects and converted the video to .webm using ffmpeg. Alpha in webm is supported natively by chrome.
